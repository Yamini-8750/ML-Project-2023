# ML-Project-2023
This is our year end project for subject Machine Learning and Data Mining
### Google - American Sign Language Fingerspelling Recognition
##### This project aims to identify and translate fingerspelling into text using American Sign Language (ASL). We will build a model that has been trained on the biggest dataset available for this competition. Over three million fingerspelled characters created by more than 100 Deaf signers are included in the data, which was taken with a smartphone's selfie camera in a range of lighting and background conditions.


##### We are referring to the code made available by the competition along with suggesting a new model and comparing the performance with the model provided by the competition
